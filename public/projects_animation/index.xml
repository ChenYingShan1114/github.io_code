      <title>Walk Cycle Animation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project explores the concept of a walk cycle using a non-character object (known as Bony) which is an abstract or simplified form that doesn’t resemble a human or animal. However, it is still a useful tool to convey believable locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without limbs or a defined anatomy, the animation relies entirely on &lt;em&gt;timing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;spacing&lt;/em&gt;, and weight shifts to create the illusion of walking. The challenge here was to break down the essence of a walk cycle into its most fundamental visual beats, such like contact, down, passing, and up, and reinterpret them in a stylized way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bouncing Ball with Legs Animation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects_animation/bouncingballwithlegs/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlike the previous &lt;a href=&#34;../bouncingballwithtail&#34;&gt;bouncing ball with a tail&lt;/a&gt;, this animation introduces legs to the ball, adding complexity and personality to its movement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key challenge was to balance the motion of the main body, which follows the principles of a traditional bouncing ball, with the legs, which provide buffering, elasticity, and propulsion. The legs not only absorb impact upon landing but also give a sense of power and intent during takeoff, making the animation feel more grounded and character-driven.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Poster Series Made by Virtual Production</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Group members: 游沛勳 彭俊諺 張哲嘉 高秉誠 陳盈珊&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During my internship as a Technical Art Intern at Moonshine Studio which is one of Taiwan’s leading animation companies, I worked with professionals from diverse backgrounds, including 2D/3D animation, motion design, visual effects, post-production for film and TV, interactive media, and technical R&amp;amp;D. While many teams focused on traditional and digital production, I joined a specialized team pioneering Virtual Production at Moonshine XR Studio which is the first studio in Taiwan to adopt this technique.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bouncing Ball with Tail Animation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects_animation/bouncingballwithtail/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects_animation/bouncingballwithtail/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This animation features a bouncing ball with a tail and a pendulum, both of which serve as ideal subjects to demonstrate &lt;em&gt;follow through and overlapping action&lt;/em&gt;, one of the &lt;strong&gt;Twelve Basic Principles of Animation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ball&amp;rsquo;s body follows the same motion logic as the previous &lt;a href=&#34;../bouncingball&#34;&gt;bouncing ball project&lt;/a&gt;, but the tail adds &lt;em&gt;secondary motion&lt;/em&gt;, trailing behind the main body to enhance realism and fluidity. This overlapping motion helps the ball feel more alive and responsive to physical forces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Light Controlled by Sound in Real-time</title>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt; 🔧 Step 1: Room Construction and Cinematic Setup &lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;Using assets from Fab, I built a 3m × 3m × 5m interior space in Unreal Engine. The scene includes a variety of lighting elements:&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• Environmental light simulates the overall ambient condition and expresses the transition between daytime and nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• Indirect (indirectional) lighting is added to fill in darker areas, ensuring that key parts of the room remain visible without relying on harsh direct light.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bouncing Ball Animation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, I used keyframe animation in Maya to simulate the motion of three types of balls, each representing a different physical behavior:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• A small yellow ball with a blue stripe acts as a bouncing ball.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• A medium purple ball with a gray stripe behaves like a heavy bowling ball.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• A large green ball with an orange stripe simulates a light, floaty beach ball.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather than solving the equations of motion, I animated each ball by manually setting keyframes and applying the &lt;strong&gt;Twelve Basic Principles of Animation&lt;/strong&gt;. Techniques such as &lt;em&gt;slow in and slow out&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;arc&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;timing&lt;/em&gt; were used to make the movements feel natural and expressive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reconstruct Pixar&#39;s WALL·E</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects_animation/walle/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After studying modeling techniques through LinkedIn Learning and receiving guidance from a friend majoring in animation at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), I took on the challenge of reconstructing the iconic WALL·E character from Pixar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This project focused on high-detail modeling in Autodesk Maya. I paid close attention to the mechanical structure, especially the eyes, body shape, and internal gears. Notably, the “WALL·E” logo on the body was not a texture but fully modeled geometry, making the result feel physically grounded and stylized.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Human Locomotion</title>

It also lies in how the body stores and releases force through the joints during movement.&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• When jogging, the joints store less force, the motion is more rhythmic and relaxed, the body’s center of gravity remains stable, and the arm swing is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• In contrast, during sprinting, the knee and ankle joints store significantly more force, the center of gravity shifts forward, and the arms swing with greater intensity to generate forward momentum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Solitude House</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects_animation/scene/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The lonely house in this piece symbolizes both physical isolation and a deeper sense of inner solitude. For me, loneliness is not just an absence of company. It’s a rare opportunity to engage in quiet, honest conversations with myself. In solitude, I’m able to calmly explore my inner world, allowing my thoughts to expand, my emotions to settle, and my perspective to deepen. It’s in these moments of stillness that I often find new strength, clarity, and resilience to face life with greater purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My First Step into Animation: Cartoon Rocket Launch</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects_animation/rocket/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects_animation/rocket/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The launch of a rocket is often seen as a symbol of venturing into the unknown, which is an idea that resonates deeply with my own journey as I step into the world of animation. This short film serves as a personal metaphor, with the rocket representing my ambitions and curiosity at the very beginning of this creative path.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rocket is designed in a simple, cartoon style, reflecting the innocence and rawness of someone just starting out. While the design remains playful, the animation is brought to life through dynamic smoke effects created using Maya&amp;rsquo;s particle system, which adds a sense of timing, weight, and immersion to the scene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
