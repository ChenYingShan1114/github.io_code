      <description>&lt;p&gt;After studying modeling techniques through LinkedIn Learning and receiving guidance from a friend majoring in animation at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), I took on the challenge of reconstructing the iconic WALL·E character from Pixar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This project focused on high-detail modeling in Autodesk Maya. I paid close attention to the mechanical structure, especially the eyes, body shape, and internal gears. Notably, the “WALL·E” logo on the body was not a texture but fully modeled geometry, making the result feel physically grounded and stylized.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
