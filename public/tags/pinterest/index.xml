It also lies in how the body stores and releases force through the joints during movement.&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• When jogging, the joints store less force, the motion is more rhythmic and relaxed, the body’s center of gravity remains stable, and the arm swing is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• In contrast, during sprinting, the knee and ankle joints store significantly more force, the center of gravity shifts forward, and the arms swing with greater intensity to generate forward momentum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
