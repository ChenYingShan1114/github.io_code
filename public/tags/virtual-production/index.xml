      <description>&lt;p&gt;Group members: 游沛勳 彭俊諺 張哲嘉 高秉誠 陳盈珊&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During my internship as a Technical Art Intern at Moonshine Studio which is one of Taiwan’s leading animation companies, I worked with professionals from diverse backgrounds, including 2D/3D animation, motion design, visual effects, post-production for film and TV, interactive media, and technical R&amp;amp;D.
