      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, I used the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulation method to study the two-stream instability which is a fundamental plasma instability that arises when two particle populations move at different velocities. The system which is shown here is triggered by setting up a current in a plasma such that electrons and ions drift at different speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a result of these relative motions, energy is transferred into the plasma, leading to the excitation of plasma waves. These waves grow over time and play a key role in phenomena such as wave–particle interactions, turbulence, and anomalous transport in plasmas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
