      <description>&lt;p&gt;Group members: Ê∏∏Ê≤õÂã≥ ÂΩ≠‰øäË´∫ ÂºµÂì≤Âòâ È´òÁßâË™† Èô≥ÁõàÁèä&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During my internship as a Technical Art Intern at Moonshine Studio which is one of Taiwan‚Äôs leading animation companies, I worked with professionals from diverse backgrounds, including 2D/3D animation, motion design, visual effects, post-production for film and TV, interactive media, and technical R&amp;amp;D. While many teams focused on traditional and digital production, I joined a specialized team pioneering Virtual Production at Moonshine XR Studio which is the first studio in Taiwan to adopt this technique.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt; üîß Step 1: Room Construction and Cinematic Setup &lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;Using assets from Fab, I built a 3m √ó 3m √ó 5m interior space in Unreal Engine. The scene includes a variety of lighting elements:&#xA;&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Environmental light simulates the overall ambient condition and expresses the transition between daytime and nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Indirect (indirectional) lighting is added to fill in darker areas, ensuring that key parts of the room remain visible without relying on harsh direct light.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;3d-gaussian-splat-model&#34;&gt;3D Gaussian Splat Model&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During my internship at ITRI, I worked on capturing multi-view images of physical objects to generate &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/MrNeRF/awesome-3D-gaussian-splatting?tab=readme-ov-file#seminal-paper-introducing-3d-gaussian-splatting&#34;&gt;3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)&lt;/a&gt; models. After taking photos from various angles, the images were processed into .ply files using our in-house pipeline. Unlike traditional point clouds, these models use anisotropic Gaussians with spherical harmonic shading, allowing them to reflect color and detail based on viewing direction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Higher-order spherical harmonics result in more vivid, accurate models‚Äîbut also require more storage. This technique excels at capturing surface details such as scratches, engravings, and textures, but has limitations when handling transparent, reflective, symmetric, or low-contrast objects due to challenges in feature detection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
