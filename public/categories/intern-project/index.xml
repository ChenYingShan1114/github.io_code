      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my internship as a Technical Art Intern at Moonshine Studio which is one of Taiwanâ€™s leading animation companies, I worked with professionals from diverse backgrounds, including 2D/3D animation, motion design, visual effects, post-production for film and TV, interactive media, and technical R&amp;amp;D. While many teams focused on traditional and digital production, I joined a specialized team pioneering Virtual Production at Moonshine XR Studio which is the first studio in Taiwan to adopt this technique.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt; ðŸ”§ Step 1: Room Construction and Cinematic Setup &lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;Using assets from Fab, I built a 3m Ã— 3m Ã— 5m interior space in Unreal Engine. The scene includes a variety of lighting elements:&#xA;&lt;p&gt;â€¢ Environmental light simulates the overall ambient condition and expresses the transition between daytime and nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;â€¢ Indirect (indirectional) lighting is added to fill in darker areas, ensuring that key parts of the room remain visible without relying on harsh direct light.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
