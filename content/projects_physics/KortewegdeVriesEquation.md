Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) play a foundational role in modeling physical phenomena involving functions of multiple variablesâ€”such as heat flow, wave propagation, fluid dynamics, and quantum mechanics. These equations describe how quantities evolve over space and time, often governed by laws of conservation, motion, or energy.

#### ðŸ§© Types of PDE Problems
Two major classes of problems arise when dealing with PDEs:

â€¢ Initial Value Problems (IVPs): Solutions evolve over time from given initial conditions. These are common in time-dependent systems like waves or diffusion.

â€¢ Boundary Value Problems (BVPs): Solutions are defined within a spatial domain with specified boundary conditions. These are often encountered in steady-state or spatially constrained scenarios.

#### ðŸ§ª Core Equations and Concepts
Some of the most studied equations in this field include:

â€¢ Diffusion Equation: Describes the spread of heat or particles (e.g., heat equation).

â€¢ Advection Equation: Describes the transport of material by a velocity field.

â€¢ Poisson Equation: A classic elliptic PDE appearing in electrostatics, fluid flow, and gravitational fields.

These core equations provide a foundation for understanding more complex physical systems.

#### ðŸ›  Numerical Techniques for PDEs
Several numerical techniques are used to discretize and solve PDEs:

â€¢ Relaxation Methods: Iteratively approach the solution of elliptic equations like the Poisson equation.

â€¢ Fourier-Galerkin Method: A spectral method using orthogonal functions (e.g., sine, cosine) to approximate PDE solutions with high accuracy.

â€¢ Stability Analysis: Evaluates the numerical behavior of a method under perturbations or over long time integration.

â€¢ Implicit and Explicit Schemes: Methods for time-stepping. Explicit schemes are simple and fast but often require small time steps for stability. Implicit schemes, such as the Crankâ€“Nicolson method, are stable under larger steps but more computationally intensive due to solving matrix systems.

## ðŸŒŠ Kortewegâ€“de Vries (KdV) Equation
The Kortewegâ€“de Vries (KdV) equation is a nonlinear PDE that models wave motion in shallow water. It combines nonlinear advection with third-order dispersion:
$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=-6\rho \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial ^3 \rho}{\partial x^3}.
$$
This equation is renowned for supporting soliton solutionsâ€”waves that maintain their shape while propagating at constant speed.
In this project, I use Dirichlet boundary conditions, \\(\rho(x= L/2)=\rho(x= -L/2)=0\\) and test the program with the known solitary wave solution \\(\rho(x,t)=2 \mathrm{sech} ^2(x-4t)\\).

### ðŸ”§ Numerical Methods Implemented
To solve the KdV equation numerically, I implemented three approaches:

â€¢ Explicit Scheme (Iterative Method): Direct time stepping with finite differences.

â€¢ Explicit Scheme (Matrix Method): Matrix formulation for improved computational structure.

â€¢ Implicit Scheme (Crankâ€“Nicolson Method): A semi-implicit method with better stability and accuracy.
