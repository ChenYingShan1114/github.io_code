This animation features a bouncing ball with a tail and a pendulum, both of which serve as ideal subjects to demonstrate <em>follow through and overlapping action</em>, one of the <strong>Twelve Basic Principles of Animation</strong>.

The ball's body follows the same motion logic as the previous <a href="../bouncingball">bouncing ball project</a>, but the tail adds <em>secondary motion</em>, trailing behind the main body to enhance realism and fluidity. This overlapping motion helps the ball feel more alive and responsive to physical forces.

Before jumping, the ball performs an <em>anticipation</em> motion by compressing slightly to convey energy buildup, making its takeoff feel more powerful and expressive. After jumping onto a platform with a swinging pendulum, the ball continues with two additional joyful hops, adding character and rhythm to the scene.
