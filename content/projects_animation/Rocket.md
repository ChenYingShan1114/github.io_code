The launch of a rocket is often seen as a symbol of venturing into the unknown, which is an idea that resonates deeply with my own journey as I step into the world of animation. This short film serves as a personal metaphor, with the rocket representing my ambitions and curiosity at the very beginning of this creative path.

The rocket is designed in a simple, cartoon style, reflecting the innocence and rawness of someone just starting out. While the design remains playful, the animation is brought to life through dynamic smoke effects created using Maya's particle system, which adds a sense of timing, weight, and immersion to the scene.

This project marks my first experiment combining modeling, animation, and visual effects in a single shot, and it reminds me that every big journey begins with a small, sincere launch.
