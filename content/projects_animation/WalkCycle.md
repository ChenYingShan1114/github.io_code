This project explores the concept of a walk cycle using a non-character object (known as Bony) which is an abstract or simplified form that doesnâ€™t resemble a human or animal. However, it is still a useful tool to convey believable locomotion.

Without limbs or a defined anatomy, the animation relies entirely on <em>timing</em>, <em>spacing</em>, and weight shifts to create the illusion of walking. The challenge here was to break down the essence of a walk cycle into its most fundamental visual beats, such like contact, down, passing, and up, and reinterpret them in a stylized way.

This exercise deepened my understanding of how motion alone can suggest intent, mass, and rhythm, even in the absence of traditional character design. It also reinforced key animation principles like <em>slow in and slow out</em>, <em>anticipation</em>, and <em>arcs</em>, which are critical to making simple forms feel alive.
