description: "A detailed 3D reconstruction of Pixar's WALL·E character, modeled and rigged in Maya. This project includes fine mechanical details, custom geometry for the logo, and hand rigging using binding and skinning techniques."

After studying modeling techniques through LinkedIn Learning and receiving guidance from a friend majoring in animation at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), I took on the challenge of reconstructing the iconic WALL·E character from Pixar.

This project focused on high-detail modeling in Autodesk Maya. I paid close attention to the mechanical structure, especially the eyes, body shape, and internal gears. Notably, the “WALL·E” logo on the body was not a texture but fully modeled geometry, making the result feel physically grounded and stylized.

After modeling, I began working on rigging the arms. Through binding and skinning, I added joint systems and control nodes, enabling the arm to move smoothly and naturally. This rigging process helped me better understand hierarchical structures and deformation behavior in character setup.

The project concludes with a final rendered sequence, showcasing both the mechanical detailing and the rigged animation in a clean, cinematic style.
