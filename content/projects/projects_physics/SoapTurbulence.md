description: "Soap films form a quasi-2D fluid system with multi-scale vortices. Driven by electric fields, they exhibit complex turbulent behaviors. This study aims to observe how small boundary vortices evolve and merge into larger structures, and to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of soap films with varying geometries."
