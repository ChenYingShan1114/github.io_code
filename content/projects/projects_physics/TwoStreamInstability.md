description: "A particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of two-stream instability in plasma, illustrating how relative drift between species leads to the excitation of plasma waves."

In this project, I used the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulation method to study the two-stream instability which is a fundamental plasma instability that arises when two particle populations move at different velocities. The system which is shown here is triggered by setting up a current in a plasma such that electrons and ions drift at different speeds.

As a result of these relative motions, energy is transferred into the plasma, leading to the excitation of plasma waves. These waves grow over time and play a key role in phenomena such as waveâ€“particle interactions, turbulence, and anomalous transport in plasmas.
