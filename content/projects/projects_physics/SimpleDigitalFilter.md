description: "This project applies Fourier transform to analyze a composite sine wave signal and demonstrates how simple equations can function as digital filters. Both low-pass and high-pass filters are applied and visualized in the frequency domain."

In todayâ€™s data-driven world, understanding macro-scale phenomena often begins with data analysis. Two key tools in this field are:

â€¢ Curve fitting, such as linear regression, which minimizes the least squares error

â€¢ Fourier transform, which decomposes signals into frequency componentsâ€”particularly useful in analyzing periodic systems

In this project, I generate a synthesized signal made up of multiple sine waves, apply simple mathematical operations, and analyze the result using Fourier transform. Surprisingly, these operations behave like digital filters in the frequency domain.

## Original Data Generation
The synthetic data is a superposition of many sine waves with increasing frequency by
$$
t_i = \frac{20(i-1)\pi}{N-1}, 
y_i = \Sigma_{j=1}^{999} {sin(jt_i)}
$$

with various frequencies sine wave, where \\(j\\) is odd and \\(y_{N+1} = y_1\\). 

## Filter Equation
We apply two simple operations on the data to act as digital filters:

â€¢ Low-pass filter
$$
z_{low} = \frac{1}{2}(y_k+y_{k+1}) 
$$
â€¢ High-pass filter:
$$
z_{high} = \frac{1}{2}(y_k-y_{k+1}) 
$$
These operations are applied element-wise to the signal and analyzed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

## Analysis Result
Below is the spectrum showing the original and filtered data:
