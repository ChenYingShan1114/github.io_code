description: "A numerical simulation of Rutherford scattering using the adaptive Runge-Kutta method to model the Coulomb interaction between an alpha particle and a gold nucleus."
---
In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_scattering_experiments#Rutherford_scattering"> Rutherfordâ€™s historic experiment </a>, alpha particles were observed to scatter when passing near the gold nuclei in a thin foil. This experiment disproved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum_pudding_model"> plum pudding model </a> and provided strong evidence for the existence of a small, dense atomic nucleus.

In this project, I recreated the scattering process using a numerical simulation of the Coulomb force between an alpha particle and a gold ion. The simulation is solved using the adaptive Runge-Kutta method, which provides high accuracy when modeling the particleâ€™s trajectory under the influence of electrostatic repulsion.

To verify the correctness of the simulation, I compared the results with the analytical theoretical solution for Rutherford scattering, showing good agreement between the two.

## Governing equations 

Rutherford scattering describes the deflection of a charged particle (such as an alpha particle) due to the Coulomb force exerted by a heavy nucleus (such as gold). The equation of motion for the alpha particle is given by:
$$
\vec{F}=\frac{q_{\alpha}q_{Au}}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{\vec{r}}{|r^3|}=m_{\alpha}\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}.
$$

Here: <br>
â€¢ \\(q_\alpha\\) and \\(q_{Au}\\) are the charges of the alpha particle and the gold nucleus, respectively, <br>
â€¢ \\(\vec{v}\\) is the displacement vector from the gold nucleus to the alpha particle,<br>
â€¢ \\(m_\alpha\\) is the mass of the alpha particle, and<br>
â€¢ \\(\epsilon_0\\) is the vacuum permittivity.


Since the simulation involves motion at the atomic scale, applying appropriate normalization and unit conversion improves numerical stability and accuracy.

## Theoritical solution 

The theoretical solution of Rutherford scattering is $$\tan{\frac{\varphi}{2}}=\frac{p_0}{2p},$$
where <br>
â€¢ \\(\varphi\\) is the scattering angle,<br>
â€¢ \\(p\\) is the impact parameter (the perpendicular distance from the initial trajectory to the center of force),<br>
â€¢ \\(p_0\\) value corresponds to the distance at which all kinetic energy is converted into electrostatic potential energy
$$p_0=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{2qq_0}{mv_0^2}.$$
