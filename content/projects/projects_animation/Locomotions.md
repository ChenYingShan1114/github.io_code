description: "A comparative animation study of human locomotion, exploring the mechanical and expressive differences between jogging, sprinting, walking, and jumping. Through careful keyframing, the project highlights how body posture, joint force, and rhythm vary across movement styles."

<h2> Between the Velocity </h2>
The difference between jogging and sprinting is not merely a matter of speed. It also lies in how the body stores and releases force through the joints during movement.

• When jogging, the joints store less force, the motion is more rhythmic and relaxed, the body’s center of gravity remains stable, and the arm swing is minimal.

• In contrast, during sprinting, the knee and ankle joints store significantly more force, the center of gravity shifts forward, and the arms swing with greater intensity to generate forward momentum.

By closely observing and animating the behavior of the knee, ankle, and upper body, this project captures the mechanical distinctions between running styles and presents the dynamic energy shifts in human motion through detailed keyframing and motion study.

<h2> Between the Steps </h2>
Walking and jumping represent two fundamental yet contrasting forms of human movement.

• Walking emphasizes a smooth weight transfer, natural arm swing, hip rotation, and consistent step length to maintain balance and fluidity.

• Jumping, on the other hand, focuses on gathering and releasing power through the legs and torso, to deliver a burst of motion driven by stored energy.

This project explores the rhythm and physical tension of both movements using the pose-to-pose animation method. Keyframes are carefully set to express the body’s dynamic balance and timing, capturing the essence of everyday movement in stylized form.
